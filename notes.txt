Balance sheet properties

I want to have as much freedom as possible to create whatever charts I want, as well as how data is entered and displayed.

// 1) Main sections can be folded up
// 2) Sum/composit numbers are calculated when all need values are present
3) Graphs that should be drawn from the balance sheet (in one to three clicks)
	(Add/remove line from each diagram)
	
	- Chronological development of each type of data (accross all balance sheets) - time is represented correctly
	- Common financial graphs (a button for each?)
	- Select types of data and how they relate to oneanother and draw the result

4) Validatoin errors are show as a red background (hover over to see the error)


// 5) Button to add another balance sheet
6) Button to create a new chart ?
7) Max limit for number of balance sheets
// 8) Button to delete a balance sheet
9) Use date picker and text to specify date
10) Denominator of the numbers (Billion, Million, Thousand)
11) slider to adjust width of columns

The same flexibility of Excel, but with fiewer clicks and more beautiful and informative + easy to read charts
